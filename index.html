                    War. War is a strange word. War is a word that sounds like
                    war. Itâ€™s short and punchy, yet also blunt and powerful. War
                    might also sound like something distant, something happening
                    somewhere far away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, now may be a time that that is less true than ever.
                    War is all around us. War is always in our pockets.

                    Frankly, how is this still happening? It's been years, but

                        Portals aren't a work of science fiction or fantasy. All
                        it takes to step through a portal is the press of a
                        button. But our portals don't just carry people, they
                        also share a much more potent resource: information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A question often asked is whether technology connects or
                        divides us. There's no denying that it does both. But
                        perhaps more than creating new division, it shows us the
                        division that already exists.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        War is a very instantaneous experience. While wars can
                        last months, the time it takes for a missile to hit is
                        measured in minutes or seconds. In our fast-paced world,
                        our perception of war is no exception. The explosion
                        from a shell is no longer heard miles away; it spans the
                        world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a result, we now must face the suffering of others
                        across the world. The only way to escape is to turn
                        away. Perhaps we are now more aware of what plagues the
                        world, but we may also have become desensitized. Our
                        brains are not equipped to handle constant violence, so
                        we choose to ignore it or grow used to it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But neither is a solution; neither allows us to realize
                        what has gone wrong. So how can we still make change
                        when we are surrounded by information and surrounded by
                        choices for an issue to pursue? How can we remain
                        optimistic through the deluge of information?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Every individual has their own approach. First, we tend
                        to search for the negative and ignore the chance that is
                        already being made. It may feel like we are alone in
                        caring, but we are not. Second, every individual cannot
                        solve every problem, and that isn't a burden we can
                        place on ourselves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nevertheless, the world has been permanently
                        transformed. Our experience with any conflict, but
                        crucially war, is now as instant and reactionary as a
                        television drama. We can choose to push war away as far
                        as we desire or pull it too close for comfort.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through these vignettes, I hope to explore this dynamic.
                        When we read about conflict, we often lack meaningful
                        context about the history of the fighters or even the
                        events of the last days. Throughout the war in Ukraine,
                        news stories have done what news stories do. They have
                        given us updates on every minute detail of the invasion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, within this model, something is lost. It's hard
                        to see the full picture. It's hard to see that Russian
                        invading forces have stormed into their neighboring
                        country unprompted. It's hard to see that Ukrainian
                        families have been torn apart and forced into hiding or
                        refuge. It's hard to see that despite the Ukrainian
                        forces' brave resistance, this war remains one-sided.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Portals suggest travel and complete immersion, but that
                        is not exactly what the internet has given us. Instead,
                        with the static photo, we only see what we are meant to
                        see. In fact, this very concept has been leveraged for
                        the sake of power, through harmful disinformation
                        campaigns throughout the world. It is easy to forget
                        that we are not fully immersed, but we never do see what
                        it outside the frame.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Likewise, as we scroll through a social media feed,
                        hopping from portal to portal, every new post is a new
                        world. We are not on a traveler's journey to discover
                        the truth, but we're only driven by algorithmic
                        recommendations. Algorithms know whether today is a day
                        one would prefer to see violent content, or if one only
                        needs to be cheered up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This piece offers an observation on how our relationship
                        to war has changed, but not a suggestion on how to react
                        to that. It's not our responsibility to constantly
                        engage in conversations about war, as that is not
                        possible. However, recognizing how a perspective can be
                        warped can allow us to correct for it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We don't see the full picture, we don't search for more
                        than we are shown, and we don't stop to slow down and
                        breathe and think. Nevertheless, we owe it to ourselves
                        and to the world to do this.
